<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>As a fisherman <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> is in the best of his humours. He makes merry
over the weaknesses of those who follow the craft of Old Izaak, always
with the slyest of genial manners. The angler's habit of exaggerating
the size of his catch&mdash;his patience or his impatience when the fish
won't bite&mdash;the conscious or unconscious ridicule he has to endure from
onlookers when he is unsuccessful&mdash;the proverbial thirst that attacks
the fisherman, whether he catches anything or not&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has a keen
eye for all such incidentals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> and presents them so jovially that nobody
laughs over them more heartily than his victims themselves do.</p>

<p>Leech, Charles Keene, Phil May, Du Maurier, Raven-Hill, Bernard
Partridge, G. D. Armour&mdash;most of the best-known <span class="smcap">Punch</span> artists, old and
new, have revelled in the humours of both fishing and shooting.</p>

<p>He gets as much laughter out of those who handle the gun. The infinite
variety of jokes he cracks about the bad shot, the man who can't hit the
birds, or is always hitting the dogs or his companion guns, is amazing.
He does not spare the lady shooter, and jests of the peril in which the
rest of the field are placed when she is out after the birds or rabbits;
and he gets a good deal of fun out of the Frenchman's alien notion of
sport.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH WITH ROD AND GUN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Observations on Ground Bait.</span>&mdash;Boys are often taught, though they never
learn, to regard fishing as a cruel amusement, when nevertheless
angling, at least as most commonly practised in the Thames, is
universally admitted to be particularly and pre-eminently the <em>gentle</em>
craft.</p>

<h2>THE DUFFER WITH A SALMON-ROD</h2>

<p class="center">FROM "THE CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER"</p>

<p>No pursuit is more sedentary, if one may talk of a sedentary pursuit,
and none more to my taste, than trout-fishing as practised in the South
of England. Given fine weather, and a good novel, nothing can be more
soothing than to sit on a convenient stump, under a willow, and watch
the placid kine standing in the water, while the brook murmurs on, and
perhaps the kingfisher flits to and fro. Here you sit and fleet the time
carelessly, till a trout rises. Then, indeed, duty demands that you
shall crawl in the manner of the serpent till you come within reach of
him, and cast a fly, which usually makes him postpone his dinner-hour.
But he will come on again, there is no need for you to change your
position, and you can always fill your basket easily&mdash;with irises and
marsh-marigolds.</p>

<p>Such are our country contents, but woe befall the day when I took to
salmon-fishing. The outfit is expensive, "half-crown flees" soon mount
up, especially if you never go out without losing your fly-book. If you
buy a light rod, say of fourteen feet, the chances are that it will not
cover the water, and a longer rod requires in the fisherman the strength
of a Sandow. You need wading-breeches, which come up nearly to the neck,
and weigh a couple of stone. The question has been raised, can one swim
in them, in case of an accident? For <em>one</em>, I can answer, he can't. The
reel is about the size of a butter-keg, the line measures hundreds of
yards, and the place where you fish for salmon is usually at the utter
ends of the earth. Some enthusiasts begin in February. Covered with
furs, they sit in the stern of a boat, and are pulled in a funereal
manner up and down Loch Tay, while the rods fish for themselves. The
angler's only business is to pick them up if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> salmon bites, and when
this has gone on for a few days, with no bite, influenza, or a hard
frost with curling, would be rather a relief. This kind of thing is not
really angling, and a Duffer is as good at it as an expert.</p>

<p>Real difficulties and sufferings begin when you reach the
Cruach-na-spiel-bo, which sounds like Gaelic, and will serve us as a
name for the river. It is, of course, extremely probable that you pay a
large rent for the right to gaze at a series of red and raging floods,
or at a pale and attenuated trickle of water, murmuring peevishly
through a drought. But suppose, for the sake of argument, that the water
is "in order," and only running with deep brown swirls at some thirty
miles an hour. Suppose also, a large presumption, that the Duffer does
not leave any indispensable part of his equipment at home. He arrives at
the stream, and as he detests a gillie, whose contempt for the Duffer
breeds familiarity, he puts up his rod, selects a casting line, knots on
the kind of fly which is locally recommended, and steps into the water.
Oh, how cold it is! I begin casting at the top of the stream, and step
from a big boulder into a hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<p>Stagger, stumble, violent bob forwards, recovery, trip up, and here one
is in a sitting position in the bed of the stream. However, the high
india-rubber breeks have kept the water out, except about a pailful,
which gradually illustrates the equilibrium of fluids in the soles of
one's stockings. However, I am on my feet again, and walking more
gingerly, though to the spectator my movements suggest partial
intoxication. That is because the bed of the stream is full of boulders,
which one cannot see, owing to the darkness of the water. There was a
fish rose near the opposite side. My heart is in my mouth. I wade in as
far as I can, and make a tremendous swipe with the rod. A frantic tug
behind, crash, there goes the top of the rod! I am caught up in the root
of a pine-tree, high up on the bank at my back. No use in the language
of imprecation. I waddle out, climb the bank, extricate the fly, get out
a spare top, and to work again, more cautiously. Something wrong, the
hook has caught in my coat, between my shoulders. I must get the coat
off somehow, not an easy thing to do, on account of my india-rubber
armour. It is off at last. I cut the hook out with a knife, making a big
hole in the coat, and cast again. That was over him! I let the fly
float<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> down, working it scientifically. No response. Perhaps better look
at the fly. Just my luck, I have cracked it off!</p>

<p>Where is the fly-book? Where indeed? A feverish search for the fly-book
follows&mdash;no use: it is not in the basket, it is not in my pocket; must
have fallen out when I fell into the river. No good in looking for it,
the water is too thick, I <em>thought</em> I heard a splash. Luckily there are
some flies in my cap, it looks knowing to have some flies in one's cap,
and it is not so easy to lose a cap without noticing it, as to lose most
things. Here is a big Silver Doctor that may do as the water is thick. I
put one on, and begin again casting over where that fish rose. By
George, there he came at me, at least I think it must have been at me, a
great dark swirl, "the purple wave bowed over it like a hill," but he
never touched me. Give him five minutes law, the hook is sure to be well
fastened on, need not bother looking at that again. Five minutes take a
long time in passing, when you are giving a salmon a rest. Good times
and bad times and all times pass, so here goes. It is correct to begin a
good way above him and come down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> him. I'm past him; no, there is a
long heavy drag under water, I get the point up, he is off like a shot,
while I stand in a rather stupid attitude, holding on. If I cannot get
out and run down the bank, he has me at his mercy. I do stagger out,
somehow, falling on my back, but keeping the point up with my right
hand. No bones broken, but surely he is gone! I begin reeling up the
line, with a heavy heart, and try to lift it out of the water. It won't
come, he is here still, he has only doubled back. Hooray! Nothing so
nice as being all alone when you hook a salmon. No gillie to scream out
contradictory orders. He is taking it very easy, but suddenly he moves
out a few yards, and begins jiggering, that is, giving a series of short
heavy tugs. They say he is never well hooked, when he jiggers. The rod
thrills unpleasantly in my hands, I wish he wouldn't do that. It is very
disagreeable and makes me very nervous. Hullo! he is off again
up-stream, the reel ringing like mad: he gets into the thin water at the
top, and jumps high in the air. He is a monster. Hullo! what's that
splash? The reel has fallen off, it was always loose, and has got into
the water. How am I to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> act now? He is coming back like mad, and all the
line is loose, and I can't reel up. I begin pulling at the line to bring
up the reel, but the reel only lets the line out, and now he's off
again, down stream this time, and I after him, and the line running out
at both ends at once, and now my legs get entangled in it, it is twisted
all round me. He runs again and jumps, the line comes back in my face,
all slack, something has given. It is the hook, it was not knotted on
firmly to start with. He flings himself out of the water once more to be
sure that he is free, and I sit down and gnaw the reel. Had ever anybody
such bad fortune? But it is just my luck!</p>

<p>I go back to the place where the reel fell in, and by pulling cautiously
I extract it from the stream. It shan't come off again; I tie it on with
the leather lace of one of my brogues. Then I reel up the slack, and put
on another fly, out of my cap&mdash;a Popham. Then I fish down the rest of
the pool. Near the edge, in the slower part of the water, there is a
long slow draw; before I can lift the point of the rod, a salmon jumps
high out of the water at me,&mdash;and is gone! I never struck him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> was too
much taken aback at the moment; did not expect him then. Thank goodness,
the hook is not off this time.</p>

<p>The next stream is very deep, strong and narrow; the best chance is
close in on my side. By Jove! here he is, he took almost beside the
rock. He sails leisurely out into the strength of the stream; if he will
come up, I can manage him, but if he goes down, the water is very swift
and broken, there are big boulders, and then a sheer wall of rock
difficult to pass in cold blood, and then the Big Pool. He insists on
going down; I hold hard on him, and refuse line. But he leaps, and
then&mdash;well he <em>will</em> have it; down he rushes, I after him, over the
stones, scrambling along the rocky face; great heavens! <em>the top joint
of the rod is loose</em>; I did not tie it on, thought it would hold well
enough. But down it runs, right down the line; it must be touching the
fish. It is; he does not like it, he jiggers like a mad thing, rushes
across the Big Pool, nearly on to the opposite bank. Why won't the line
run? The line is entangled in my bootlace. He is careering about; I feel
that I am trembling like a leaf. There, I knew it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> happen; he is
off with my last casting-line, hook and all. A beauty he was, clear as
silver and fresh from the sea. Well, there is nothing for it but a walk
back to the house. I have lost one fly-book, two hooks, a couple of
casting-lines, three salmon, a top joint, and I have torn a great hole
in my coat. On changing my dress before lunch, I find my fly-book in my
breast pocket, where I had not thought of looking for it somehow. Then
the rain comes, and there is not another fishing day in my fortnight.
Still, it decidedly was "one crowded hour of glorious life," while it
lasted. The other men caught four or five salmon apiece; it is their red
letter day. It is marked in black in my calendar.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To <span class="smcap">Well-Informed Piscatorials</span>.&mdash;<em>Query.</em> What sort of fish is a Nod?</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> A Nod is a sea-fish, and is, probably, of the limpet tribe. This
we gather from our knowledge of the Periwinkle, known in polite circles
as the 'Wink. The value of the Nod has come down to us in the form of an
old proverb, "A Nod is as good as a 'Wink," and this no doubt originated
the query to which we have satisfactorily replied.</p>

<h2>THE ANATOMY OF SHOOTING</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Men we Never Meet</span></p>

<p>1. The man who makes no excuses for shooting badly; such as&mdash;1. The
light was in his eyes; 2. He was bilious; 3. There was something wrong
with his cartridges; 4. Too many cigars the night before; 5. Some
particular eatable or drinkable taken the night before; 6. Or that
morning; 7. He was afraid of hitting that beater; 8. We were walking too
fast; 9. He hadn't got his eye in; 10. Or his eye was out; 11. He didn't
think it was his bird; 12. It was too far off; 13. He always thought
there was something the matter with <em>that</em> gun.</p>

<p>2. The man whose dog hasn't a good nose.</p>

<p>3. The man who can't "shoot a bit sometimes."</p>

<p>4. The man who hasn't some particular theory as to&mdash;1. The very best
gun; 2. Cartridges; 3. Charges of powder and shot; 4. Best tipple to
shoot on; 5. Best sort of boots; 6. Gaiters; 7. And equipment generally.</p>

<p>5. The man who doesn't change the said theory every season.</p>

<p>6. The man who hasn't sometimes said he couldn't shoot after lunch.</p>

<p>7. Or that he could shoot better after lunch.</p>

<p>8. The man who on your remarking that your friend George Lake is a good
shot, doesn't answer that you should see Billy Mountain (or someone
else) and then you would know what shooting really was.</p>

<p>9. The man who hasn't a friend who "can't hit a haystack."</p>

<p>10. The friend who owns it.</p>

<p>11. The man who doesn't like to be considered a good shot.</p>

<p>12. The man who, being a bad shot, doesn't comfort himself by thinking
he knows a worse.</p>

<p>13. The man who hasn't made a longer shot than anyone in the company.</p>

<p>14. The man who, having made it, doesn't tell the story.</p>

<p>15. And who, having told the story, doesn't tell it more than once.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Mr. Punch</em> is never likely to meet the man who, having read
the above, will not own that it is strictly true of those who pursue the
pleasant pastime of shooting when, as the eminent Burton puts it, "they
have leisure from public cares and business."</p>
